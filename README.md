# Kitchen Kraving
## What is This? ##
This is a VR game developed by me (programmer & project manager), Oliver (programmer), Jonathan (artist), Mary (artist), and Mike (sound designer). In the game, the player is a hungry chef who is trying to eat as much food as possible while fulfilling orders without getting caught by the boss, who is checking up on the player randomly. 

## How can I play this? ##
1. Download the repository 
2. Run `KitchenKravings_DirectToRift.exe` if you are running on an Oculus Rift device 
3. Run `KitchenKravingsPCx64.exe` if you are running on a HMD other than a Rift
